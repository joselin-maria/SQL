Weâ€™ve used a WITH statement to create two temporary tables:

january contains all song plays from January 2017
february contains all song plays from February 2017
Use a left join to combine january and february on user_id and select user_id from january.

Add the following WHERE statement to find which users played songs in January, but not February:

WHERE february.user_id IS NULL

WITH january AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM plays
  WHERE strftime("%m", play_date) = '01'
),
february AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM plays
  WHERE strftime("%m", play_date) = '02'

)
SELECT january.user_id
FROM january
LEFT JOIN february
ON january.user_id = february.user_id
WHERE february.user_id IS NULL;
