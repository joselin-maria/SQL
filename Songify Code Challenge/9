The following query will give us the number of times that each song was played:

SELECT song_id,
   COUNT(*) AS 'times_played'
FROM plays
GROUP BY song_id;

Use a WITH statement to alias this code as play_count.

Join play_count with songs and select (in this order):

songs table’s title column
songs table’s artist column
play_count‘s times_played column
Remember that play_count.song_id will match songs.id.

WITH play_count AS (
  SELECT song_id,
   COUNT(*) AS times_played
FROM plays
GROUP BY song_id
)
SELECT songs.title,
songs.artist,
play_count.times_played 
FROM play_count
JOIN songs
ON play_count.song_id = songs.id;
