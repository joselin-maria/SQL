Letâ€™s see which plans are used by which premium members!

The column membership_plan_id in premium_users should match the column id in plans.

Join plans and premium_users and select:

user_id from premium_users
description from plans
(Be sure to select the columns in this order)


SELECT premium_users.user_id,
   plans.description
FROM premium_users
JOIN plans
  ON plans.id = premium_users.membership_plan_id;
