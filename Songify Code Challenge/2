Letâ€™s see the titles of songs that were played by each user!

The column song_id in plays should match the column id in songs.

Join plays to songs and select:

user_id from plays
play_date from plays
title from songs
(Be sure to select the columns in this order)

SELECT plays.user_id,
   plays.play_date,
   songs.title
FROM plays
JOIN songs
  ON plays.song_id = songs.id;
