Which users arenâ€™t premium users?

Use a LEFT JOIN to combine users and premium_users and select id from users.

The column id in users should match the column user_id in premium_users.

Use a WHERE clause to limit the results to users where premium_users.user_id IS NULL. This will remove premium users and leave you with only free users.

SELECT users.id
FROM users
LEFT JOIN premium_users
ON users.id = premium_users.user_id
WHERE premium_users.user_id IS NULL;
