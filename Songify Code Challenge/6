Replace the SELECT statement in your CROSS JOIN with the following statement:

SELECT premium_users.user_id,
  months.months,
  CASE
    WHEN (
      premium_users.purchase_date <= months.months
      )
      AND
      (
        premium_users.cancel_date >= months.months
        OR
        premium_users.cancel_date IS NULL
      )
    THEN 'active'
    ELSE 'not_active'
  END AS 'status'

This will tell us if a particular user is 'active' or 'not_active' each month.

SELECT premium_users.user_id,
  months.months,
  CASE
    WHEN (
      premium_users.purchase_date <= months.months
      )
      AND
      (
        premium_users.cancel_date >= months.months
        OR
        premium_users.cancel_date IS NULL
      )
    THEN 'active'
    ELSE 'not_active'
  END AS 'status'
 FROM months
 CROSS JOIN premium_users;
