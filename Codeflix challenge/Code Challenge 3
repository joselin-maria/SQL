The watch_history table has the following columns:

id
user_id
watch_date
watch_duration_in_minutes

1.
The UX Research team wants to see a distribution of watch durations. They want the result to contain:

duration, which is the watch event duration, rounded to the closest minute
count, the number of watch events falling into this “bucket”
Your result should look like:

duration	count
1.0     	9
2.0      	21
3.0     	19
…	        …

Use COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to create this result and order this data by increasing duration.

SELECT ROUND(watch_duration_in_minutes,0) AS duration,
COUNT(*) AS 'count'
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY watch_duration_in_minutes;
