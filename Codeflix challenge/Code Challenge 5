The watch_history table has the following columns:

id
user_id
watch_date
watch_duration_in_minutes

Generate a table of user ids and total watch duration for users who watched more than 400 minutes of content.

Use SUM(), GROUP BY, and HAVING to achieve this.

SELECT user_id,
SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS 'Total_duration'
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY 1
HAVING Total_duration >400;
