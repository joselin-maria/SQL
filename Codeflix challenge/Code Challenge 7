The payments table has the following columns:

id
user_id
amount
status
pay_date

Which days in this period did Codeflix collect the most money?

Your result should have two columns, pay_date and total amount, sorted by the latter descending.

This should only include successful payments (status = 'paid').

Use SUM(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

SELECT pay_date , SUM(amount)
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY pay_date
ORDER BY sum(amount) DESC;
