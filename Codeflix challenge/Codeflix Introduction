A streaming video company, Codeflix, needs your help analyzing their user data. Weâ€™ve imported a portion of their dataset into the SQL workspace for this lesson.

The database contains 3 tables:

users contains the basic account details for each user
payments contains payment details for a 3 month period
watch_history contains watch events for the users
